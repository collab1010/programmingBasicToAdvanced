/*
In C programming, a character variable holds ASCII value (an integer number
between 0 and 127) rather than that character itself. This integer value is the
ASCII code of the character.

For example, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65.

What this means is that, if you assign 'A' to a character variable, 65 is stored
in the variable rather than 'A' itself.

Now, let's see how we can print the ASCII value of characters in C programming.
